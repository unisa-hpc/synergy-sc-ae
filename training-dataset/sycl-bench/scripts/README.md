## Parsing logs
`logs_parser.py`:
- input: logs results files
- output: csv file with the following header:
    `"kernel-name, core-freq, memory-freq, kernel-time [s], run-time [s], energy [J]"`
- command line args:
    - argv[1] -> path to logs directory
    - argv[2] -> path to output directory

## Compute energy metrics
`add_energy_metrics.py`:
- input: csv file generated with logs_parser.py
- output: csv file with added energy metrics (edp , ed2p)
- command line args:
    - argv[1] -> path to parsed logs directory
    - argv[2] -> path to output directory

## Merge execution data and kernel features
### Micro-benchmarks
`merge_micro.py`:
- input: path to csv file generated by add_energy metric.py and path to csv file with kernel features
- output: merged csv file
- command line args:
    - argv[1] -> path to parsed logs with edp and ed2p
    - argv[2] -> path to features csv
    - argv[3] -> path to output directory
### Sycl-bench
`merge_sycl_bench.py`:
- input: path to csv file generated by add_energy metric.py and path to csv file with kernel features
- output: merged csv file
- command line args:
    - argv[1] -> path to sycl-bench results with edp and ed2p
    - argv[2] -> path to features csv
    - argv[3] -> path to output directory

NOTE: when merging with the normalized kernel features, use `norm` as an argument to also normalize the core frequencies

## Plots

### Multi-objective plots
`multi_obj_plot.py`:
- input: csv file generated by merge_*.py script
- output: multi objective plot where x axis is Speedup, y axis is normalized energy and z axis Core frequency
- command line args: 
    - argv[1] -> path to merge_*.py csv results folder
    - argv[2] -> path to output directory 

### EDP and ED2P plots
`edp_ed2p_plot.py`:
- input: csv file generated by merge_*.py script
- output: edp and ed2p plot where x axis is Core Frequency and y axis edp or ed2p
- command line args: 
    - argv[1] -> path to merge_*.py csv results folder
    - argv[2] -> path to edp output directory
    - argv[3] -> path to ed2p output directory
